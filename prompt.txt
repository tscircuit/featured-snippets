SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in the same language they are using.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: macOS-14.6.1-arm64-arm-64bit
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/zsh
SYSTEM - Language: en_US
SYSTEM - Current date: 2024-11-01
SYSTEM - The user is operating inside a git repository
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM import math
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def factorial(n):
SYSTEM     "compute factorial"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     if n == 0:
SYSTEM         return 1
SYSTEM     else:
SYSTEM         return n * factorial(n-1)
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM     return str(factorial(n))
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM     return str(math.factorial(n))
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM hello.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM main.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM from hello import hello
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.

ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.

USER Hello!
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.
